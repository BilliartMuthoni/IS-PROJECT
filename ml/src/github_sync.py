"""Commit and push the repository clone on Drive from a Colab session.

main is protected, so changes are committed to a new branch and pushed there,
and the returned link opens a pull request. The Drive copy is then switched
back to main so the next session's pull keeps working. The token is passed
only on the push command line and never written to the Git config.
