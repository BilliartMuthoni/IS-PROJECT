"""Image-only crop disease classifier (ResNet-50, chosen in the architecture comparison, #41).

Loads a model.pt exported by ml/notebooks/08 or 09: the architecture name, weights,
class list, image size and normalisation, so preprocessing here matches the
evaluation transform used in training exactly. Any architecture from the comparison
can be loaded, so switching models is a matter of changing ML_MODEL_PATH.

Crop rule: the farmer says which crop the photo shows. The model still scores all
11 classes; the answer is the best class *of that crop*, and its confidence is the
original 11-class probability -- deliberately NOT rescaled over the crop's classes.
Rescaling would let a tomato photo submitted as maize come out as a confident maize
diagnosis. Without it, if the model's top class belongs to another crop, the best
class of the chosen crop is below 0.5; since the threshold is never below
MIN_THRESHOLD = 0.5, any disagreement about the crop always ends in a referral.
The rule can only turn diagnoses into referrals, never create one.

Crop left out (several photos of mixed crops): the crop is detected as the one whose
classes hold the most probability, then the same rule applies. Detection is reliable
on familiar photos (100% on the test set) but wrong 27% of the time on PlantDoc,
usually with confidence, so the app shows the detected crop and lets the farmer
correct it (POST /diagnose/{id}/crop); with the farmer's crop, PlantDoc accuracy
rises from 28% to 40% (measured 14 Oct with ResNet-50's saved predictions).

Confidence is not calibrated yet; temperature scaling comes in Sprint 4.
