"""Treatment guidance for the 11 classes the model predicts.

Grounded content only -- the system retrieves and presents this text as written
rather than generating advice. Sources should be verified Kenyan agricultural
references (KALRO, CABI PlantwisePlus, county extension guidance) before this
is used with real farmers; the entries below are placeholders pending that review.
Sprint 3 replaces this module with the ChromaDB knowledge base with citations.

Keys are the model's class names (PlantVillage folder names).
